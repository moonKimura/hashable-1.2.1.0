Version 1.1.1.0

* Improved instances for tuples and lists.

* Added instances for StableName, Float, Double, Integer, and Ratio.

Version 1.1.1.0

* Added hashWithSalt, which allows the user to create different hash
  values for the same input by providing different seeds.  This is
  useful for application like Cuckoo hashing which need a family of
  hash functions.

* Fixed a bug in the Hashable instance for Int64/Word64 on 32-bit
  platforms.

* Improved resilience to leading zero in the input being hashed.

Version 1.1.0.0

* Added instance for: strict and lazy Texts, ThreadId

* Added hashPtrWithSalt and hashByteArrayWithSalt.

* Faster ByteArray# hashing.

* Fixed a signedness bug that affected ByteString.

* Fix ByteString hashing to work correctly on both 32 and 64-bit
  platforms.

Version 1.0.1.1

* Fixed bug in Hashable instance for lazy ByteStrings where
  differences in the internal structure of the ByteString could cause
  different hash values for ByteStrings that are equal according to
  ==.

Version 1.0.1.0

* Added two helpers for creating Hashable instances: hashPtr and
  hashByteArray.

Version 1.0.0

* Separated Hashable class to its own package from hashmap 1.0.0.3.
